## Thought Process
I thought the best option to avoid repeats was to organize the number of lemonades and pretzels bought into a 2D array, as well as the tips.
After that, I wrote functions to total the sum of the values in those arrays. After that, the next step was to subtract those sums from the initial inventory values, and to add the tips. The final step was to put those values into print statements.
